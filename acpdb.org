* Command-line syntax

apcfit -h [inputfile [outputfile]]

The input file is a keyword-driven case-insensitive text
file. Comments are #. If the input or the output file are not present,
stdin and stdout are used. If the output file is not present, stdout
is used.

* Definitions

- Structure: the structural information about a molecule or crystal.

- Property: a quantity calculable by running a few molecular or
  crystal calculations and that is linear in the total energies. 

- Method: a method for the calculation of a property. Can be a
  "reference method" (expensive and/or from the literature), an
  approximate method (usually the target of ACP fitting), or an
  additional method (additional contributions to the energy, like a
  dispersion correction).

- Set: a group of properties, usually from an article in the
  literature and calculated with a reasonably good method.

- Traning set: the set of all properties that are used for ACP
  development. Comprises one or more sets.

- Dataset: the training set plus additional information such as atoms,
  angular momentum channels, etc. The dataset completely determines
  the ACP fitting problem.

Whenver set names are required, an asterisk stands for the current
training set. When a method name is required, an asterisk stands for
the method used in the original reference.
