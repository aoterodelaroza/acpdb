#+STARTUP: showeverything

-- do the reduction, coef0? -> in the dump
   It has to be the slope or ACPeval will not work.

DUMP

  Write the octavedump.dat file for the LASSO fit corresponding to the
  current dataset.

  trainset -> dump

-- automatic testing on github & upload zz_source
-- clean up extra keywords and code in trainset and acpdb --
-- copy over from the code --
-- build energy differences from total energies --
-- own implementation of LASSO in c++ --
-- how to maxcoef, nonlinearity, critic2 to run ECPs with the libecp
-- build all the databases
